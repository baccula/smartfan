# smartfan

This is an adaptation of code created by casper-gh and JZ which allows for HTTP GET control of an ESP8266 from SmartThings. The GETs are mapped to GPIO pins on the ESP8266 which allow for control of relays. The relays are connected to the standard Hunter ceiling fan remote, allowing for automated control of the fan.
